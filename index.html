        I would walk or bike from my house to the outlets, except there is one part where Nichols crosses a creekbed that I would have to be directly in the road. Honestly, so far north (I live near Lake St and the 15) there is really nowhere for me to walk to.

        There are no sidewalks in several areas close to my home.

        Making sure the cars notice that your walking either on a crosswalk or while crossing the street.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        The biggest challenge is I don&#39;t have time to walk, but I walk dogs. What keeps me from walking is school.

        I live in a residential area where people do not abide by the speed limit.  People are constantly driving at dangerous speeds &amp; I do not feel comfortable with my children or I near the street or sidewalk. Crossing the street can be very dangerous at times with drivers coming around the corner at a very high-speeds.

      <li>
        Not enough sidewalks
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Safety. Lack of sidewalks. Speed limits on road to children school is too fast.

      <li>
        No sidewalks on railroad
      </li>
      
      <li>
        There are many hills that are tiring to walk up but also many people living on the streets that make me mildly uncomfortable and afraid to walk near. I also live up in Tuscany Hills so if I want to walk down towards stores and restaurants I must go down Summerhill and then come back up later.

      <li>
        Speed limit on Lincoln and Grand
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Lack of sidewalks and feeling safe to walk in busy intersections. I&#39;d really like to ride a bike but there is limited bike lanes, especially on Lakeshore Dr.

        Not enough sidewalks, especially on major roads -- even near schools! (Lakeshore near Elsinore Middle)

      <li>
        Lack of sidewalks
      </li>
      
      <li>
        No, school bus for pick up. Parents working no choice but walking to school
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Roadways are poorly lit, cars are speeding too fast, limited amount of sidewalks, a general feeling of not feeling safe due to the number of intoxicated transients.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        I would say the lack of sidewalks, crosswalks and the recklessness of other drivers.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        No hay carreteras para caminar  por donde yo camino . No hay sombra en las banquetas por donde camino como en la Lincoln. En la grand is una banqueta de tierra

        Poor sidewalks or lack of sidewalks. Long distances. Safety
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Safety, lack of sidewalks, unsafe crime and drug filled areas that do have sidewalks are unsafe to walk
      </li>
      
      <li>
        A lack of sidewalks and crosswalks near my neighborhood. The nearest stores and places of my interest are more than half a mile away.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        I would love to be able to run to the other side of the lake, but lack of sidewalks make it dangerous

          Would be great if kids had a path to ride bikes and scooters so they don’t plow into other kids walking to/from school from Westwind Dr to Regatta Way. Thank you for the consideration.

        <li>
          Most of Lakeshore Dr is missing sidewalks although parts are now being paved. Would be great to see the whole street from Lake to Main St properly paved for walking and biking.  Thank you
