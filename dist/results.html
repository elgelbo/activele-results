            No, school bus for pick up. Parents working no choice but walking to school
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Roadways are poorly lit, cars are speeding too fast, limited amount of sidewalks, a general feeling of not feeling safe due to the number of intoxicated transients.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            I would say the lack of sidewalks, crosswalks and the recklessness of other drivers.

          <li>
            I would love to be able to run to the other side of the lake, but lack of sidewalks make it dangerous
          </li>
          
          <li>
            No hay carreteras para caminar  por donde yo camino . No hay sombra en las banquetas por donde camino como en la Lincoln. En la grand is una banqueta de tierra
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Poor sidewalks or lack of sidewalks. Long distances. Safety
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Safety, lack of sidewalks, unsafe crime and drug filled areas that do have sidewalks are unsafe to walk
          </li>
          
          <li>
            A lack of sidewalks and crosswalks near my neighborhood. The nearest stores and places of my interest are more than half a mile away.

                I would walk or bike from my house to the outlets, except there is one part where Nichols crosses a creekbed that I would have to be directly in the road. Honestly, so far north (I live near Lake St and the 15) there is really nowhere for me to walk to.

                I live in a residential area where people do not abide by the speed limit.  People are constantly driving at dangerous speeds &amp; I do not feel comfortable with my children or I near the street or sidewalk. Crossing the street can be very dangerous at times with drivers coming around the corner at a very high-speeds.

                There are many hills that are tiring to walk up but also many people living on the streets that make me mildly uncomfortable and afraid to walk near. I also live up in Tuscany Hills so if I want to walk down towards stores and restaurants I must go down Summerhill and then come back up later.

                Rocks, glass, debris, and thorns due to dry conditions make it easier for riders to get flat tires and other damages. Certain areas are difficult to cross and ride through due to fast traffic and having to share the road with vehicles.
