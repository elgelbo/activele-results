                <pre>I would walk or bike from my house to the outlets, except there is one part where Nichols crosses a creekbed that I would have to be directly in the road. Honestly, so far north (I live near Lake St and the 15) there is really nowhere for me to walk to.</pre>

                <pre>There are many hills that are tiring to walk up but also many people living on the streets that make me mildly uncomfortable and afraid to walk near. I also live up in Tuscany Hills so if I want to walk down towards stores and restaurants I must go down Summerhill and then come back up later.</pre>

                <pre>Rocks, glass, debris, and thorns due to dry conditions make it easier for riders to get flat tires and other damages. Certain areas are difficult to cross and ride through due to fast traffic and having to share the road with vehicles.</pre>
